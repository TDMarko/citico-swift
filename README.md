TODO:
1) - [x] Remove unused cells from table
2) - [x] Add date to cell
3) - [x] Allow to edit note
4) - [x] Delete only one note
5) - [x] Add popups with messages "Note has been added" and "Note has been deleted"
6) - [x] Add check for non-empty input before note save
7) - [ ] Add sorting

BUGS:
1) - [x] Delete note deletes all notes in Core Data storage
2) - [ ] Sometimes in Table View wrong cell is greyed out
3) - [x] Table View needs an update after note delete (probably stays in operating memory)
4) - [ ] After update cell is not in right place, add sorting
